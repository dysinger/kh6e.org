    <p>Update 9/14/2011.&nbsp; The location has been changed to <span
        style="font-family: Times New Roman;">THE FERAL PIG located in
        Harbor Mall at Nawiliwili.</span><font face="Arial"><span

    <p>Join Us for Breakfast!<br>
      <br>
      If you haven't taken part in the Saturday breakfast in a while,
      you are in for a surprise.&nbsp; Kauai Amateur Radio Club members,
      spouses, and guests make up some of the twenty or so that take
      part in this weekly ritual over at The Feral Pig. The attendees
      have grown over the past year and now even the XYL's have joined
      in.&nbsp; These gals, however, have taken up residence at a
      separate table, no doubt to discuss matters other than ham radio!<br>
      <br>
      As with breakfasts in the past, no club business is discussed, and
      KARC membership in not a requirement to participate.&nbsp; It’s
      just a fun and casual way to start off your Saturday among friends
      who share the love of amateur radio.&nbsp; There is plenty of
      informal discussion on ham radio but subject matter can range from
      topics like solar power, weather, travel and family updates,
      between omelette and pancake bites.&nbsp; Everyone arrives and
      leaves as they please, but most congregate at about 8 AM.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      If you are a new ham, the breakfast is an excellent venue to get
      your amateur radio questions answered from hams who possess a
      wealth of knowledge coupled with many years of experience.<br>
      <br>
      So, if you haven't attended a breakfast in a while, come by and
      check it out.&nbsp; I'm sure you'll enjoy the company, and don't
      forget to bring the non-ham member of the family too -- everyone
      is welcome! &nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>Harbor Mall has a "paid" parking lot...take your ticket in to
      breakfast with you, and get it validated. The parking attendant is
      hardly ever there on Saturday mornings, but better to get it
      validate just in case.<br>
