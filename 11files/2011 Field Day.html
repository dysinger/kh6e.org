Kauai Amateur Radio Club members and guests will operate the club station <B>KH6E</B> around the clock for 24 hours.&nbsp; </P>

<P>This annual event, called &quot;Field Day&quot; is sponsored by the ARRL, the national association for Amateur Radio. Using only emergency power supplies, ham operators will construct emergency stations in parks, shopping malls, schools and backyards around the country. Their slogan, &quot;When All Else Fails, Ham Radio Works&quot; is more than just words to the hams as they prove they can send messages in many forms without the use of phone systems, internet or any other infrastructure that can be compromised in a crisis.  On Kaua`i during Hurricane Iniki, local Hams were the first to send messages and emergency communications to off island locations.</P>

<P>Last year, more than 35,000 amateur radio operators across the country participated in this annual event.  Hams from across the USA will be holding public demonstrations of emergency communications abilities.  We will be showing the newest digital and satellite capabilities, voice communications and even historical Morse code.  Join us at the NYC facilities in the Nawiliwili Harbor, June 25, to meet and talk with the hams. See what modern Amateur Radio can do. They can even help you get on the air!
