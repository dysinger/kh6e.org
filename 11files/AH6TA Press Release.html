<P>The Kaua'i Amateur Radio Club (KARC) offers free field communications support to nonprofits and community-based organizations. The services include deploying FCC-licensed radio operators and equipment to special events to provide reliable communications between various outlying points and the event headquarters.  Recent supported events have included the Koloa Sugar Mill Run and the Thanksgiving Day Turkey Trot Run.</P>

<P>Our operators all use completely self-contained equipment and require no outside power sources or other infrastructure. Many areas on the island have spotty or no cell coverage, but amateur radio works anywhere.  Providing these free services gives our trained Emergency Communications Network members an opportunity to practice their skills and mentor younger licensed operators in a real-world environment.</P>

<P>Any community-based organization is invited to contact the Kaua'i Amateur Radio Club at the earliest opportunity to apply for services.  Resources will be allocated according to first-come, first-served and scheduled at least one month in advance.</P>

<P>Interested parties may e-mail Jane at <a href="mailto:jegold1016@gmail.com">jegold1016@gmail.com</a>; phone Jane at 332-7691; or e-mail Elaine Albertson (AH6TA) at
