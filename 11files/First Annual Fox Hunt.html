<P>Kauai ARC Fox Hunts are open to all amateur radio operators in the community who want to have fun and follow the rules. Attention to safety is the most important rule.&nbsp; Be sure you are in a safe location before taking bearings to the fox.&nbsp; All hunt teams should consist of two to four members, although this is not a requirement.&nbsp; At least one member in each team must hold a valid amateur radio license.&nbsp; The purpose of each exercise is to find the hidden transmitter (the Fox) with the least number of traveled miles and within the allocated time specified for the hunt. This criterion may be changed if specifically called-out in the hunt rules for the specific hunt.&nbsp; Starting odometer readings will be taken before the hunt begins.&nbsp; If an odometer doesn't have a tenth of a mile reading, both the mileage and trip mileage should be recorded.<BR>
<BR>
At the specified starting time, the fox will begin transmitting for a period of 1 minute. All hunters are expected to measure and plot their initial bearing during this 1 minute period.&nbsp;&nbsp; After that time, the fox will transmit in 60 second segments every 4 minutes.   Both the hunters and fox will transmit on the same frequency.&nbsp; Hunters should use short and concise transmitting protocol to avoid being confused with the fox transmissions.&nbsp; After plotting three or four bearings to the fox, all hunters should have a fairly well defined search target.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
The fox will be located within 10 miles of the starting point, within the boundaries of pages 19, 20, 22, 23, or 24 of &quot;The Ready Mapbook of Kaua`i&quot; (as in 5<SUP>th</SUP> edition).&nbsp; He will also be located in plain sight in a publicly accessible area within 100 feet of a public parking spot.&nbsp; The fox may tease hunters by providing hints to his location.&nbsp; However, these hints should be given in a manner that all hunters will hear and understand equally.&nbsp; Poetry will be politely tolerated. The fox should attempt to make a written log of hints provided.&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">**** Fox Hunt Schedule ****</P>

<P>9:15AM: Meet in the 4444 Rice ST parking lot near the round building for a discussion about fox hunting techniques, explanation of the basic fox hunt rules and to get answers to your fox hunting questions. Watch for notices pointing toward the designated meeting area. </P>
<P>9:45AM:&nbsp; Meet the official starter to get your car's odometer reading and team member names recorded.&nbsp;Odometer readings are a must. If no tenths of a mile on the odometer, record the trip and regular mileage. You should get your first bearing from the parking lot.</P>
<P>10:00AM: Hunt will start promptly at this time. The fox will make his first 60 second transmission at this time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Further transmissions will be made for 60 seconds at 4 minute intervals.</P>
<P>12:00 Noon: The hunt will end unless extended by the fox. </P>

<P>Frequency: Primary is 146.46 MHZ <BR>
Power will decrease as the hunt progresses at the discretion of the fox. &nbsp;</P>
<P>You will need: HT or portable 2-meter transceiver with a normal mobile antenna, direction finding antenna, County or local map, pen/pencils, COMPASS, ruler or PROTRACTOR, watch.</P>
<P>Advanced equipment such a Doppler antenna or any computer assisted equipment is not allowed. <BR>
All teams must stay together during the hunt.</P>
<P>Transmission Sequence: At 10:00 am, the fox will begin transmitting for a period of 1 minute. All hunters are expected to measure and plot their initial bearing during this one minute period. After that time, the fox will transmit in 60 second segments every 4 minutes.</P>

<P>Both the hunter and fox will transmit on the same frequency. Hunters should use short and concise transmitting protocol to avoid being confused with the fox transmissions. After plotting three or four bearings to the fox, all hunters should have a fairly well defined search target. 
</P>
<P>He will also be located in plain sight in a publicly accessible area within 100 feet of a public parking spot. The fox may tease hunters by providing hints to his location. However, these hints should be given in a manner that all hunters will hear and understand equally. Poetry will be politely tolerated. The fox should attempt to make a written log of hints provided.</P>

<P>Remember: The team that locates the fox within the time limit, while driving the shortest number of miles will be the winner.</P>

<P>Review: A word from Rookie Fox: &nbsp;&nbsp;I will be in&nbsp;plain sight. You still won't be able to find me.&nbsp; You only have two hours! I might have more hints for you later.&nbsp; Good luck!&nbsp; Catch me if you can.</P>

<P>Did You Know Fox Hunting can be habit-forming?</P>
<P>Disclaimer:<BR>
Fox hunting can be habit forming, frustrating, humiliating and darn-right ham boggling. It has also been known to grow loop antennas on ham shack mice. Participate at your own risk -- and have a good time!</P>

<P>Courtesy Notice:<BR>
Fox hunting is a very serious training exercise designed to train amateur radio operators to locate jamming radio transmitters during emergency situations.&nbsp; Willingly telling another ham's XYL/OM any different is a violation of the ham code</P>
