<p class="MsoNormal">The Makani Pahili Hurricane Exercise 2008 will be in May 
again this year.&nbsp; The main Amateur Radio participation will be on Saturday, May 
24, 2008, 0900W to 1200W.&nbsp; <br>
This is one week later than last year.&nbsp; Please remember that information is 
subject to revision or modification.&nbsp; Updates will come later.<br>
<br>
Primary frequencies for State RACES will be HF 7088 kHz, 3993.5 kHz, 1870 kHz, 
depending on band conditions and State RACES VHF repeater system: 147.02+ Mhz 
(Maui), 147.04+ MHz (Big Island and Kaua`i), and 147.06+ (O`ahu).&nbsp; These are the 
same frequencies that the Tuesday night 1900W PacSecARES net use.&nbsp; The time has 
been extended to 1200W because HF 40m has frequently come up at about 1100W.&nbsp; 
Please note that the State RACES VHF repeater system is fully linked thanks 
primarily to Robin Liu, AH6CP, State RACES Assistant Coordinator and architect 
of the system.<br>
<br>
Please treat this hurricane exercise as a chance to practice everything you've 
got.&nbsp; The next time you use it, it may be for the real thing.&nbsp; The hurricane 
season starts June 1 and runs until November 30 in the Central Pacific (other 
dates for other areas.)&nbsp; However, destructive weather and other disasters can 
happen anytime.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The Makani Pahili Annual Statewide Hurricane Exercise allows many Hawai`i State, 
Federal, national, and non-governmental organizations (NGO) to work through a 
real-time exercise involving a hurricane striking the State of Hawai'i.&nbsp; The 
scenario is not given ahead of time.&nbsp; Agencies react as much as possible as they 
would during a real emergency without necessarily going into the field.&nbsp; 
However, the Amateur Radio community is encouraged to use this exercise as a 
chance to coordinate with your served agency to go and provide simulated 
emergency communications.&nbsp; If you are not affiliated with a served agency, maybe 
now is the time to do so.&nbsp; Many worthwhile agencies exist such as State RACES, 
O`ahu RACES, O`ahu HealthComm, Big Island HealthComm, Skywarn, SATERN, American 
Red Cross (operators of the shelters), and more.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
In addition to Saturday, May 24, Amateur Radio operators will have a chance to 
participate during the main portion of the exercise.&nbsp; On Wednesday, May 21, 
1000W to 14000W Amateur Radio emergency communicators (EmComm ops) will have a 
chance to send traffic in to State Civil Defense (SCD).&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past, we have 
only had the Saturday, Amateur Radio-only, post-hurricane, recovery net exercise 
which has not allowed EmComm ops to participate with the different agencies.&nbsp; 
The Wednesday, May 21, net will be while the simulated hurricane is striking.&nbsp;
<b><u>More details for the Wednesday participation will be announced later.</u></b><br>
<br>
<b>As always, please be flexible since the information, times, and requirements 
may change.&nbsp; Ron Hashiro, AH6RH, State RACES coordinator may add, modify, or 
update these announcements.&nbsp; <br>
Different agencies and areas may have their own requirements.</b><br>
<br>
Lastly, we need all the help we can get during a real emergency.&nbsp; The best help 
will come from trained Amateur Radio EmComm Ops who are serving an agency, BUT 
that does not mean that an unaffiliated licensed Amateur Radio operator can't 
help - it just makes it more difficult.&nbsp; It doesn't take much to get involved 
and hooked up with an agency or organization active in disasters.&nbsp; Pick out a 
group that suits you and ask to work with their Amateur Radio group.&nbsp; If you 
think that you are not interested, but know deep in your heart that you would 
come up during&nbsp; a real emergency, then you owe it to yourself and others to 
learn the basics and do the minimum necessary to become properly associated.&nbsp;
