# A Message From The Kaua'i Amateur Radio Club President

Aloha!  I want to welcome you to beautiful Kaua'i, and the Kaua'i
Amateur Radio Club Website.  We are a lively group of amateur radio
operators who have a common interest in all aspects of amateur radio
operation.

Our web site lists many of the activities in which we're currently
involved and interesting historical information demonstrating the
[public service communications]({{relative to 'pscomms.html'}}) we
provide when disaster strikes.

All interested visitors are invited to attend our
[monthly club meetings and other functions]({{relative to
'info.html'}}).  Licensed hams are also encouraged to participate in
our [regular nets]({{relative to 'info.html'}}).  The Club also
participates in a [Saturday Morning Breakfast]({{relative to
'socialize.html'}}).  We eagerly invite any visitors to join us to
“Talk Story”.  Spouses and families are also welcome.

The Kaua'i ARC offers license-testing sessions each quarter.  If you
are interested in obtaining an FCC Amateur Radio License, contact John
Montalbano at KH6JMM@HAWAII.RR.COM and we will provide you with the
latest information on where and when the next testing session will
be.

Aloha and welcome to Kaua'i.  Visiting hams, please give us a call on
our repeaters and let us enjoy a QSO while you visit our island.  We
enjoy helping our visitors to enjoy our beautiful island.

73’s
