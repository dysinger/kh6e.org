###Notes:
* We would like to visit Mt. Kahili soon for maintenance.  Because the
  location is isolated, we must use helicopters to get to the repeater
  site.  If you would charter a helicopter for us, you can go with us
  on our visit to the repeater.  Seriously, helicopter is the only way
  we can get to the repeater and we do need a ride. Please contact a
  club officer.
* We are a small group of Hams here on Kaua'i, so you might not hear
  much activity.  About half of us work and the other half are busy
  with retirement.  Please call and do not give up trying to contact
  us.  We will answer and would like to have a QSO with you.
