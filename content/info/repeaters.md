# Kauai Repeaters

{{> repeaters }}

###Notes:
* Tones are not used on any Kaua'i repeaters.
* The "linked" repeaters are operated and maintained by the Kaua'i
  Amateur Radio Club. They cover most (about 75%) of the populated
  areas on Kaua'i.
* All of our repeaters are solar powered with storage batteries. Our
  main repeater KH6E is located on Mt. Kahili, a high isolated
  mountain top for better coverage.  It has been operating for many
  years with very little maintenance.  We would like to visit the site
  soon for maintenances reasons.  Because the location is isolated, we
  must use helicopters to get to the repeater site.  If you would
  charter a helicopter for us, you can go with us on our visit to the
  repeater.  Seriously, helicopter is the only way we can get to the
  repeater and we do need a ride. Please contact a club officer.
* We are a small group of Hams here on Kaua'i, so you might not hear
  much activity.  About half of us work and the other half are busy
  with retirement.  Please call and do not give up trying to contact
  us.  We will answer and would like to have a QSO with you.
