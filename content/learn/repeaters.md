# Repeaters Repeaters Repeaters

_Yes we have repeaters on the Garden Island, Kaua'i._ View these
repeaters on our <a href="{{relative to 'map.html'}}">
interactive map page</a>.

### Notes:
* Tones are not used on any Kaua'i repeaters.
* The first four repeaters are operated and maintained by the Kaua'i
  Amateur Radio Club. They are linked together to cover most (about
  75%) of the populated areas on Kaua'i.
* The 146.660 MHz repeater is not linked and covers most of the area
  around Hanamaulu and Lihue.
* The 147.340 MHz repeater is located in the Wailua Homestead and
  covers most of Lihue and Kapaa areas.  It is also has Echolink.
* The 147.040 MHz is a RACES repeater located in Lihue and is linked
  to RACES repeaters located on the other Hawaiian Islands.
* The 147.550 MHz repeater is Simplex with IRLP node.  You might hear
  the IRLP side of the conversation and not the local Ham here on
  Kaua'i.
* All of our repeaters are solar powered with storage batteries. Our
  main repeater KH6E is located on Mt. Kahili, a high isolated
  mountain top for better coverage.  It has been operating for many
  years with very little maintenance.  We would like to visit the site
  soon for maintenances reasons.  Because the location is isolated, we
  must use helicopters to get to the repeater site.  If you would
  charter a helicopter for us, you can go with us on our visit to the
  repeater.  Seriously, helicopter is the only way we can get to the
  repeater and we do need a ride. Please contact a club officer.
* One last note.  We are a small group of Hams here on Kaua'i, so you
  might not hear much activity.  About half of us work and the other
  half are busy with retirement.  Please call and do not give up
  trying to contact us.  We will answer and would like to have a QSO
  with you.
73 and Aloha de KH6E and AH6TA, Webmaster.
