# Skywarn Spotter Training

Are you interested in weather and assisting the National Weather
Service (NWS) in reporting significant weather conditions in your
area?  The NWS relies on volunteer spotters to assist the service in
reporting possible dangerous weather conditions.  Greg Hall, the
Official-in-Charge from the NWS Lihue office, will be doing a Skywarn
Spotter class and explain weather systems and detail what should be
reported.

If you would like to attend the free 3 hour training, please contact
Tad Miura at ZSSQ@Hotmail.Com for more info.  Reservations for the
class is required and limited to 8 individuals due to the room size.
The date has not been set, but the class is normally done on a weekday
morning.
