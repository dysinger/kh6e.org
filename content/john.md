# Goodbye, KH6JMM

Our hearts are saddened to pass along the news that KH6JMM is now
silent key. John Montalbano, President of Kauai Amateur Radio Club,
passed away peacefully at Wilcox Hospital on Friday, 28 March,
following a sudden, brief illness. He was born February 6, 1944. He
worked diligently to promote the ham radio club and its activities on
Kaua'i. He will be remembered fondly and missed by many.

Celebration of life for John Montalbano was held on Wednesday evening,
April 1 at Garden Island Mortuary in Lawai, HI. (2-3780 B Kaumuali ªi
Highway)

We have setup a <strong>John Maltabano Memorial Repeater</strong> fund
