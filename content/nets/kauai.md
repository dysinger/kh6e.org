# Kaua'i Island Nets

We have several regular nets on Kaua'i.  The purpose of the nets is to
give us a chance to regularly practice our technique and test our
equipment. The local net list is as follows:

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-hover table-condensed">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>When</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
{{#each nets}}
    <tr>
      <td>{{name}}</td>
      <td>{{when}}</td>
    </tr>
{{/each}}
  </tbody>
</table>

All licensed hams are encouraged to participate.  View KARC repeaters
on our [information page]({{relative to 'info.html'}}) and on the
[interactive map]({{relative to 'map.html'}}).
