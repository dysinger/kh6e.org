# Public Service Communication (PSC) Net

## Thursdays, 7:00 PM, Kauai Amateur Radio Club Repeaters

Join us for the weekly PSC Net. We do one round of comments from those that
check in. One Fldigi message is transmitted at the beginning of each net, using
MT-63 1KL. If you would like to take a turn at being the NCS operator for this
net please email **Tad Miura, NH7YS, Kauai RACES Coordinator** at
[ZSSQ@hotmail.com](mailto:ZSSQ@hotmail.com?subject="Public Service
Communications Meeting")
