# CERT-ARES-RACES Comms Exercise

## WEDNESDAY, MARCH **23RD** (not 2nd)

A joint CERT-ARES-RACES communications exercise will take place on
Wednesday March 23rd from 9 am to 12 noon.  We will be utilizing the
both communications trailers.  One will be located in Princeville, and
one will be located in the student parking lot at Kapaa High school.
We will also be training with the new walkie talkies aka. Family Radio
Service (FRS) radios.  Everyone is welcome to attend this training,
and it will be a great time for HAM operators to practice their
skills, and all other CERTs to train with the FRS radios.  Please
respond asap and let me know if you will attend at the Princeville
location (Prince Edwardâ€™s Park) or the Kapaa Location (Kapaa High
School student parking lot) If you have the time and are not working,
please try to attend.
