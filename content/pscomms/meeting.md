# Public Service Communications Meeting

## November 16, 2015 5:30 PM

Antennas will be the topic of the next Public Service Communications
meeting.  If you would like to share information on your favorite
antenna, please bring it to the meeting and tell us why you like it so
much.  We will have various antennas on hand for handheld and mobile
radios, and possibly some portable HF antennas as well.  Contact Tad
Miura, NH7YS, at ZSSQ@Hotmail.Com for more information.  The meeting
will be held at the Lihue Civic Centerâ€™s Planning Room 2A/B. The
meeting room is about 100' south (left) of DMV in the Civic Center.
