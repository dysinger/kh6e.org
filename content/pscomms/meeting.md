# Public Service Communications Meeting

## April 18, 2016 @ 5:30PM @ Lihue Civic Center Planning Room 2A/B

Coinciding with April’s Tsunami Awareness Month in Hawaii, we will be doing a
tsunami tabletop exercise for the Public Service Communications meeting. A
tabletop exercise is an activity which is designed to test the theoretical
ability of a group to respond to a situation. The meeting begins promptly at
5:30pm and ends at 7:00pm.

For more information, please email **Tad Miura, NH7YS, Kauai RACES Coordinator**
at [ZSSQ@hotmail.com](mailto:ZSSQ@hotmail.com?subject="Public Service
Communications Meeting") or **Randy Blake, WH7ZI, ARES District Emergency
Coordinator** at [wh7zi@me.com](mailto:wh7zi@me.com?subject="Public Service
Communications Meeting").

The meeting will be held at the Lihue Civic Center’s Planning Room 2A/B. The
meeting room is about 100' south (left) of DMV in the Civic Center.
